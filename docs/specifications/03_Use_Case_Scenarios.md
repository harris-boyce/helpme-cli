```bash
$ helpme "I want to try docker but I'm worried about messing up my system, help me start safely"

🤖 Smart approach! Let's start Docker safely 🛡️
   
   **Safe Learning Strategy:**
   ✅ We'll use isolated containers (won't affect your system)
   ✅ I'll explain each command before we run it
   ✅ Easy cleanup - nothing permanent until you're ready
   
   **Beginner-Safe First Steps:**
   
   1. **Check if Docker is installed:**
      ```bash
      docker --version  # Just checks, doesn't change anything
      ```
   
   2. **Your first safe container (Hello World):**
      ```bash
      docker run hello-world  # Downloads & runs test container
      ```
      ↳ This downloads a tiny test image and runs it once
      ↳ Completely isolated from your system
      ↳ Automatically stops and can be easily removed
   
   **What this WON'T do:**
   ❌ Won't modify your files
   ❌ Won't change your system settings  
   ❌ Won't interfere with other applications

                                                    ←─── feature/api-auth
   ```
   
   **For your current task, you probably want:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop                    # Start from latest development
   git pull origin develop                 # Get latest changes  
   git checkout -b feature/your-task-name  # Create your feature branch
   ```
   
   **Why this approach:**
   - Your changes don't affect others until ready
   - Team can review your work before merging
   - Easy to switch between different features
   
   What's your current task? I'll show you the specific commands.
