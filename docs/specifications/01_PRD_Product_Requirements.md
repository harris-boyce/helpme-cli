# HelpMe-CLI: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: September 2025  
**Document Owner**: Development Team  
**Review Cycle**: Quarterly

---

## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
HelpMe-CLI transforms the command-line interface into an **intelligent execution assistant** that eliminates workflow friction through contextual problem diagnosis and automated resolution. Rather than recreating web-based chat interfaces, we leverage CLI strengths: direct system access, environmental context, and scriptable execution.

### Mission
To provide immediate, accurate, and safe problem resolution that respects user agency while dramatically reducing the cognitive overhead of technology troubleshooting through intelligent system integration.

**Key Differentiation**: Executes diagnostics and solutions vs. suggests commands to copy

---

## Problem Statement

### Core Problem
Technology professionals face constant micro-frustrations compounded by tool fragmentation and manual diagnostic processes. Current AI assistants require context switching to web interfaces and provide suggestions that still require manual execution and verification.

### Pain Points Identified
1. **Manual Diagnostic Overhead**: Time-consuming manual system investigation for common issues
2. **Context Switching Friction**: Moving between terminal, browser, documentation, and chat interfaces
3. **Suggestion-to-Execution Gap**: AI tools suggest commands but don't execute or verify results
4. **Environmental Blindness**: Generic solutions that don't account for user's specific system context
5. **Emergency Response Inefficiency**: Critical issues requiring immediate action but delayed by manual investigation

### Market Opportunity
- **Primary Market**: CLI-comfortable developers, DevOps professionals, SREs
- **Growth Vector**: CLI tool adoption + AI assistant integration + demand for immediate problem resolution
- **Open Source First**: Community-driven growth through execution capabilities differentiation
