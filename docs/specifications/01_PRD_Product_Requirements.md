## Technical Requirements Overview

### Core Capabilities (Current Implementation)
1. **Provider Abstraction**: Genkit-based AI provider switching (Gemini, Ollama)
2. **Structured Responses**: JSON-based command suggestions with explanations
3. **Interactive TUI**: Ink-based React components for professional CLI experience
4. **Context Detection**: System environment, git status, project type awareness
5. **Safety Classification**: Basic command risk assessment and user confirmation

### Integration Requirements (Practical Scope)
- **AI Providers**: Genkit ecosystem (Gemini, Ollama, future: Claude, OpenAI)
- **System Integration**: Cross-platform Node.js (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Context Sources**: Git repos, package managers, common dev tools
- **Distribution**: npm package, global CLI installation

### Performance Requirements (Realistic Targets)
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds for AI generation (network dependent)
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when AI providers unavailable
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal memory footprint, no persistent processes
- **Compatibility**: Node.js 18+, common shells (bash, zsh, fish)

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI Provider Outages**: Multi-provider support, clear error messages
- **Network Connectivity**: Offline graceful degradation, cached responses
- **Command Safety**: Conservative classification, user confirmation prompts

### Community Risks  
- **Low Adoption**: Focus on immediate practical value, easy onboarding
- **Contributor Scarcity**: JavaScript accessibility, clear contributing guidelines
- **Maintenance Burden**: Leverage existing tools (MCP) vs. custom solutions

### Product Risks
- **Feature Creep**: Maintain focus on core command suggestion value
